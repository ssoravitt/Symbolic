# Symbolic

- Original code by FMP notebook (https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C1/C1S2_MIDI.html).
- The MIDI and MusicXML files are the music stimuli from MUSEC project (https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/MUSEC).
- Therefore, the Github adjusts the codes for easily individual understanding. In the future, the codes will be applied to the MUSEC project, contributing to symbolic music study.
