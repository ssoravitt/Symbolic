# Symbolic

- Original code by FMP notebook (https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/C1/C1S2_MIDI.html)
- The MIDI and MusicXML files are the music stimuli from MUSEC project (https://github.com/IoBT-VISTEC/MUSEC) 
- Therefore, the Github aims to apply the codes to the MUSEC project in the future, contributing to symbolic music.
